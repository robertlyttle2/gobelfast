            <p class="card-text">Belfast's original rooftop bar and winner of the coveted ‘Best Outdoor Space’ category at the LCN awards, The Perch is located in the historic Linen Quarter, beside sister bars Rita's, Sweet Afton and Tutti Frutti.

              Enjoy cocktails and sangria in the height of summer and hot cider, winter warmers and blankets in the winter.

              Located on the fifth floor of the historic Linenhouse Building, The Perch Rooftop Bar is a space like no other in Belfast. It has a beautiful central bar, surrounded by original window features, brick-clad walls and generously adorned
              with birdcages and all things avian, in honour of the bar’s namesake.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The Spaniard Bar was established in 2006 and has grown in reputation. Hidden in the depths of the Cathedral Quarter, be careful not to miss out. Providing a cosy, intimate atmosphere once you enter it becomes hard to
              exit. Attracting a collaboration of interesting folk do not be surprised if you end up meeting a cousin/friend/relative twice removed, or even chatting to a stranger who becomes a new friend for life.</p>
